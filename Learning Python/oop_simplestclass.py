class Person:
    pass  # An empty block


p = Person()
print(p)  # It tells us that we have an instance of the Person class in the __main__ module.

# Notice that the address of the computer memory where your object is stored is also printed. The address will have a
# different value on your computer since Python can store the object wherever it finds space.
