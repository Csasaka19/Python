# ---------- READING & WRITING TEXT ----------

# The os module provides methods for file processing
import os

# We are able to store data for later use in files

# You can create or use an already created file with open

# If you use w (write) for mode then the file is
# overwritten.
# If you use a (append) you add to the end of the file

# Text is stored using unicode where numbers represent
# all possible characters

# We start the code with with which guarantees the file
# will be closed if the program crashes
with open("mydata.txt", mode="w", encoding="utf-8") as myFile:
    # You can write to the file with write
    # It doesn't add a newline
    myFile.write("Some random text\nMore random text\nAnd some more")

# Open the file for reading
# You don't have to provide a mode because it is
# read by default
with open("mydata.txt", encoding="utf-8") as myFile:
    # We can read data in a few ways
    # 1. read() reads everything into 1 string
    # 2. readline() reads everything including the first newline
    # 3. readlines() returns a list of every line which includes
    # each newline

    # Use read() to get everything at once
    print(myFile.read())

# Find out if the file is closed
print(myFile.closed)

# Get the file name
print(myFile.name)

# Get the access mode of the file
print(myFile.mode)

# Rename our file
os.rename("mydata.txt", "mydata2.txt")

# Delete a file
# os.remove("mydata.dat")

# Create a directory
# os.mkdir("mydir")

# Change directories
# os.chdir("mydir")

# Display current directory
print("Current Directory :", os.getcwd())

# Remove a directory, but 1st move back 1 directory
# os.chdir("..")
# os.rmdir("mydir")
