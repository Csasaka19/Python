 How to Use doctest_in_help.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``my_function()``.

Numbers
=======

``my_function()`` returns the product of its arguments.  For numbers,
that value is equivalent to using the ``*`` operator.

::

    >>> from doctest_in_help import my_function
    >>> my_function(2, 3)
    6

It also works with floating-point values.

::

    >>> my_function(2.0, 3)
    6.0

Non-Numbers
===========

Because ``*`` is also defined on data types other than numbers,
``my_function()`` works just as well if one of the arguments is a
string, a list, or a tuple.

::

    >>> my_function('a', 3)
    'aaa'

    >>> my_function(['A', 'B', 'C'], 2)
    ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C']
